After runnung this container you have to initialize YouComplete for use, start following script:

	prepare_vim.sh

If you want use Volume for persistent data, please use direcory /home/user/ENVIRONMENT_DATA 
Following script is performing backup of all data in /home/user/ to /home/user/ENVIRONMENT_DATA

	backup.sh

Follwing script restore all data, especially content of .vim and .vimrc from /home/user/ENVIRONMENT_DATA into /home/user/

	restore.sh



NOTE: This is not the perfect solution fo now, but Iam working on that. I wanted to use the whole home direcory /home/user/ as persistent location
but that is not working very well. you have to change permissions on the host directory location, to be used in the docker container as it should () 
Other dfirectories created by docker building process inside /home/user are vanished.(chown user:users  <directory_shared_with_docker_container>)
Maybe vim runtime can be changed to search inside /home/user/ENVIRONMENT_DATA.
